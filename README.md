This is my vim config file.

I originally just used [@benawad](https://github.com/benawad)'s init.vim and have slowly been adding/changing things. Here is his orginial one: https://gist.github.com/benawad/b768f5a5bbd92c8baabd363b7e79786f 

He discussed his in length in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnupOrSEikQ
